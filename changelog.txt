we fixed a bug:

currently the rebuild logic is:

if B depends on A, A changed, then B will be rebuilt.

However this model has a bug: if I run nomake inside B,
then when building A, it will think all projects are updated.
To solve this, instead of maintaining the dependency to check rebuild,
we should compare all the library targets
